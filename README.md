# Terraform AWS Infrastructure Management

This Terraform project is designed to manage AWS infrastructure. It uses Terraform to provision and manage resources in AWS, ensuring a consistent and reproducible infrastructure setup.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
- AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources.
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials.

## Project Structure

- `resources.tf`: Contains the definitions of the AWS resources to be managed.
- `variables.tf`: Defines the input variables for the Terraform configuration.
- `outputs.tf`: Specifies the outputs of the Terraform configuration.
- `providers.tf`: Configures the providers required for the project.
- `locals.tf`: Defines local values used within the configuration.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Initialize the Terraform configuration:**

    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```

3. **Review and modify variables:**

    Edit the `variables.tf` file to set the appropriate values for your environment.

4. **Plan the infrastructure changes:**

    ```sh
    terraform plan
    ```

    Review the plan output to ensure it matches your expectations.

5. **Apply the infrastructure changes:**

    ```sh
    terraform apply
    ```

    Confirm the apply action when prompted.

6. **Destroy the infrastructure (if needed):**

    ```sh
    terraform destroy
    ```

    Confirm the destroy action when prompted.
